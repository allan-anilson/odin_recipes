    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The secret ingredient in this fluffy French toast recipe: all-purpose flour! Flour binds the liquids together, which creates a more traditional “batter” and helps prevent soggy results.</p>
    <p>This extra ingredient ensures the French toast is crispy on the outside, but soft and fluffy on the inside. </p> 
    <h4>Ingredients:-</h4>
 
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> This fluffy French toast batter starts with ¼ cup all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk:</strong> Milk adds moisture and richness to the batter. You can substitute half-and-half, cream, or your favorite alternative milk if you like.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Of course, you’ll need eggs for French toast! Three eggs bind the batter together and give it a rich texture. </li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> A tablespoon of white sugar lends welcome sweetness to this decadent breakfast recipe. </li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> A teaspoon of vanilla extract adds complexity and takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
        <li><strong>Cinnamon:</strong> Ground cinnamon lends coziness and warmth.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won’t make your French toast taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Bread:</strong> You’ll need 12 slices of your favorite thick-sliced bread. Good choices include brioche, sourdough, French bread, or challah.</li>
    </ul>
     
    
    
    <h4>Steps:-</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Slowly whisk the milk into the flour, then whisk in the remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Saturate the bread slices in the batter. </li>
        <li>Cook the French toast on a lightly oiled griddle or pan until golden on both sides.</li>
    </ol>
